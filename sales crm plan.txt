Here's a clear, structured plan for your Sales CRM Admin Dashboard, combining real-world practical features with a dynamic backend system that allows admins to toggle features on/off or customize their CRM experience.

✅ Part 1: Real-World Sales CRM - Feature List (Dynamic Options)
🎯 Core CRM Features (Always ON by Default):
📊 Dashboard: KPIs (Leads, Deals Closed, Revenue, Conversion Rate).

👥 Customer Management: Add, Edit, View, Segment Customers.

📝 Interaction Logging: Track meetings, calls, emails, notes.

💰 Deal Pipeline: Visual Kanban for stages like Lead → Proposal → Negotiation → Won/Lost.

🛠️ Optional Features (Dynamic Enable/Disable by Admin):
Category	Feature	Purpose
✅ Lead Management	Lead Scoring	Score leads based on activity & fit.
✅	Auto Lead Assignment	Assign leads to salesmen via round-robin or region.
✅	Web-to-Lead Forms	Capture leads directly from website forms.
✅ Task Management	Task Automation	Auto-create follow-up tasks post-call/meeting.
✅	Reminders & Notifications	Salesmen get notifications for pending tasks.
✅ Reporting	Advanced Sales Reports	Downloadable reports: performance, funnel, revenue.
✅	Custom Report Builder	Admin creates custom fields/metrics in reports.
✅ Integrations	Email Integration	Sync Gmail/Outlook for email tracking.
✅	WhatsApp/Telegram CRM Integration	For quick customer interactions.
✅	Call Recording	Store call recordings linked to customer profile.
✅ Geo/Location	Geo-Fencing	Salesmen can check-in only at client locations.

✅	Quotation Generator	Auto-generate quotes with templates.
✅ Broadcast & Announcements	Broadcast Messaging	Admin sends announcements to sales teams.
✅	Motivational Leaderboards	Display top performers to gamify CRM.

✅ Part 2: How to Implement Dynamic Option Selection (Backend + Frontend Plan)


🎁 Frontend (Admin Dashboard):
Settings Page → Feature Management Section:

Toggle switches for each optional feature.

Options like: Enable Lead Scoring, Enable Call Recording.

You store these preferences in the backend.

🏗️ Backend (Database Structure Suggestion):
✅ 1. Database Table: company_feature_settings
Column	Type	Description
id	int	Primary Key
company_id	int	Foreign key to company
feature_key	varchar	Example: 'lead_scoring'
is_enabled	boolean	True/False
updated_at	datetime	Last modified date

Example Entry:

yaml
Copy
Edit
| 1 | 5 | lead_scoring | true | 2025-07-21 |
✅ 2. API Endpoints (FastAPI / Flask):
GET /company/features → Returns list of active features for the company.

POST /company/features/update → Admin toggles feature ON/OFF.

Features Middleware (backend layer):

Every endpoint checks if a feature is active:

python
Copy
Edit
if not is_feature_enabled(company_id, 'lead_scoring'):
    return {"error": "Feature disabled by admin"}, 403
✅ 3. Backend Logic Summary:
When admin toggles a feature → backend saves it in company_feature_settings.

Every module (leads, tasks, reports) queries this table before showing options.

If Lead Scoring is off → remove button from salesman dashboards.

Frontend UI dynamically adapts via /company/features API.

✅ Part 3: Example Data Flow Summary
Admin toggles → backend saves → frontend calls features → modules enable/disable accordingly.
✅ Example Admin Flow:
Admin → Feature Management → enables Lead Scoring and Call Recording.

POST /company/features/update with:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "features": {
        "lead_scoring": true,
        "call_recording": true
    }
}
Salesman dashboards now show Lead Scoring, Call Recording modules.

Reports auto-include call duration KPIs.

Later, admin disables Call Recording → API hides features instantly.

✅ Summary Action Plan

✅ 2	Build REST APIs to fetch/update feature settings
